# cross plat project with react native (Android, iOS, Desktop-tauri)

<https://reactnativeexample.com/react-native-everywhere-expo-android-web-ios-tauri-desktop/>

TL;DR: use react native as frontend for everything and serve the frontend in different platform using different technologies.

```txt
Android, iOS, Web -> react native by default
Desktop           -> tauri can be used to serve plain html, css and javascript file, so react native can be used once builded
```
